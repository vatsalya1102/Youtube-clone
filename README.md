## Details

- This project, to create Youtube clone, was assigned to me by Gro.care, where I have applied for internship role. This project has compelled me to further improve my knowledge of ReactJS while also pushing me to learn new technologies.

- While I knew HTML, CSS, JS and React, I had never implemented Video Player in any of my projects. So, when learning about it, I began using HTML5 video player. However, after trying it and testing it, I figured that its design is not much customisable. So, I then shifted to React Player library which was much easier to understand and implement.

- I had done fetching API and using it in some of my previous projects, so I was comfortable with it, as Gro.care has already provided the API.

- I chose a minimalistic design for the UI and I hope it is attractive and user friendly.

- I believe this project delivers the expectations that Gro.care has from me. Feel free to reach out to me for any queries and suggestions.
